# ese519-lab2B-part1-10 Feedback

- Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).

I think all the parts of lab are not difficult to understand, but the introduction part is too concise. Most of time, I don't know what method should I use here to complete the lab task. I understand that such a broad lab introduction allows us to solve problem from different aspects, however it also makes feel confuse sometimes. It's my problem　that I don't have my own understanding of the problem　sometimes. 

- Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.

Programming the PIO is most difficult to understand. It takes me a lot of time to read code of pio-sdk and pio-example in order to understand the purpose of the code. 

- Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your answer.

NA

- What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.

Most of time, I will open github to see my classmate repos which is helpful for me to solve my confusion.
