### TODO:

- modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed
- with a partner, connect a second Qt Py to the Stemma Qt bus of an ADPS9960 that's attached to a first Qt Py running the Lab 1 Python code
- record a trace of this exchange

## Connection
We connect a second Qt Py to the Stemma Qt bus of an ADPS9960 that's attached to a first Qt Py

## Screenshoot of I2C traffic
We connect two RP2040 and ADPS9960 well and run the firefly code from Lab1. Then, we press the BOOT button and record the timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange.
